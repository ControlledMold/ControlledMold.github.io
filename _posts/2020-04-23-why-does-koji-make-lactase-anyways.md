An interesting question came up on the Koji subreddit about if one can make lactose-free milk at home using koji. It's known that many fungi, including aspergillus oryzae (koji), produce the enzyme lactase, which breaks down lactose. See the Figure 1 below:

*Figure 1:The lactase enzyme working on lactose sugar. Lactose is made up of glucose and galactose molecules.*


Research has shown that koji produces lactase on a wide variety of substrates, including wheat bran and spent beer grain - but these substrates don't contain lactose. In fact, the only natural source of lactose is mammelian milk, and koji didn't evolve to ferment milk. So why is koji producing lactase? What's going on? 

### Mystery 
Let's start with the first mystery: why does koji produce lactase in the first place? First, we note that lactase only acts on lactose (i.e. lactase has a very high _specificity_), so lactose must be present somewhere. Second, we note that lactase is an intracellular enzyme, that is, it is only present _in_ the cell. From this, we can conclude that lactose is present inside the cell. The koji is also "digesting" other carbohydrates, like starch, cellulose and hemicellulose. The former two are well known, but hemicellulose may not be. It's a carbohydrate that is found in plants, and contains a wide variety of sugars (not just glucose, the only sugar in cellulose). Galactose is one such sugar present in hemicellulose. When a galactose is attached to a glucose molecule, this looks like a lactose. During digestion of hemicellulose by other enzymes (cellulase, etc.), the glucose-galactose aka lactose molecule is released.

*Figure 2: Hemicellulose is a carbohydate found in plants and made up of many different sugars. Enzymes acting on itwill liberate smaller sugars, like lactose.*


This lactose molecule still needs to be broken down to be metabolised, hence lactase is needed (see Figure 1.). This solves the myserty of why fungi produce lactase. 

### Another mystery appears

In [1](https://sci-hub.tw/10.1016/0168-1656(90)90065-J), the authors record that koji grown on a wheat bran substrate actually produces more lactase than a koji grown on whey (which is full of lactose). What explains that? The authors suggest that when lactose is high, a moderate amount of lactase will generate enough glucose and galactose that further lactase production is supressed. Here's a high level explaination of why. With an abundance of lactose and some lactase present, intracellular glucose levels will be high, and there exists an internal feedback loop that halts further production of enzymes that aren't needed (like lactase) . So there exists an amount of lactase that balances this feedback loop. However, when lactose is limited, glucose is limited, and hence that feedback loop is never triggered, meaning that lactase is continuously produced.
