We'll go through the  steps required to make your own koji - *without using koji-kin (spores)*. You'll still need a source of the koji, but that can be from innoculated rice you've previously purchased. 

### Theory
To grow Koji successfully, we need to provide it with a healthy environment. This means: warm, humid, free of competing microbes, rich in nutrients, high in carbon source, available oxygen. The substrate source can really be anything (one reason why Koji is so amazing), but the enzymes produced will be a function of the substrate. For example, a substrate that is high in fats (lipids) will encourage the koji to produce more lipase. 
### Protocol

Here's what you'll need beforehand: 

 - 20g of innoculated koji and a coffee grinder, **or** pack of koji-spores
 - 500g of a substrate: dried barely or rice
 - pressure cooker
 - glass tray
 - serving spoon
 - clean towel
 - incubator (see my post on making a cooler-incubator)
 - sanitizer (ex: StarSan, 70% alcohol)
 - spray bottle with water

1\. Soak the substrate (rice or barely) for 10-14h. A few inches of water above the barely is good. 

2\. Rinse the substrate. Place into a pressure cooker. Add about 0.5in of water.

3\. Pressure cook for 15min, and remove from heat. Keep closed to avoid introducing contaminants. Let cool down for a few hours. Have a tea. Do the next few steps.

4\. Sanitize the spoon, tray, coffee grinder, and inside of the incubator. 

5\. If using innoculated koji, grind in coffee grinder until powdered.

6\. Once cooker is warm-to-the-touch: in a draft-free area, open the pressure cooker slightly and stick in a sanitized thermometer. Wait for it to read less than 45℃. If so, transfer the substrate to the tray (the spoon helps). The transfer should cool the substrate down to less than 40℃, which is needed to not kill the koji inoculant. The grains should feel soft and easy to squish.

7\. Sprinkle about half the koji powder onto the substrate, and mix with your hands. Sprinkle the next half on and mix again.

8\. Form "peaks and throughs" with the substrate. Your goal is to maximize the surface area of the koji. Koji needs oxygen, and more surface area means more available oxygen (called *oxygen mass transfer*). 

9\. Cover tray with dampened towel (rinse towel over water, wring out until only a few drops leave). 

10\. Place tray in incubator, and dig the temperature probe into the middle of the substrate. This is very important - your temperature readings will be off if it's not inside the substrate. Close the incubator, and set the equilibrium temperature anywhere in 30℃ to 32℃. Modestly spray the towel and sides of the incubator with water.

11\. Have a tea, the hard part is now done. Let sit for 24 hours, monitoring the temperature to make sure it doesn't exit the temperature window. If it gets to warm, open the lid slightly. If you do this,  spray the towel a few times with water (unless it looks like it's dripping). 

12\. After 24 hours, remove the tray from the incubator. Hopefully you should see something like the following (if not, see step 13.)

13\. If there is not much growth, check the dampness of the towel. If should still feel almost *too* wet. If it's dry, or nearly dry, give it lots of sprays of water and go back to step 10. 

14\. If everything looks healthy, break the substrate up with your hands. You goal is to maximize surface area, and bring the bottom of the substrate (which should have less growth on it) closer to the surface.

15\. Place the tray back into the incubator. The koji will be very active for the next 12 hours, so much so that it will be generating its own heat. If not monitored, the heat could spike to above 40℃ and kill the koji. Your goal is to not let that happen.
   1. Again, make sure the probe is embedded into a "nugget"
   2. If the temperature starts to exceed 34℃, crack the lid open. The temperature may very slowly come back down, so make sure you are not letting the towel dry out.
  
16\. After 10h-12h, remove the koji from the incubator. It should be a "cake" of mycellium:

17\. To halt the koji growth, cover with a lid and place in refrigerator. 

18\. Useful tip: after a few hours, open the lid and wipe off the condensed mositure from the lid. This moisture can fall into the koji and create sour aromas later.
