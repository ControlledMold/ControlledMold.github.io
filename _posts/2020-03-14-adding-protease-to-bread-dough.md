The main components of flour, starches and gluten, can be modified using enzymes to change the color, flavour and mouthfeel of finished bread. Here's an application of barley koji to make your homemade bread more interesting.

### What is the effect of enzymes on bread dough?

Koji contains two enzymes that will effect bread dough. *Protease*, an enzyme that cuts gluten, will start to chop up the gluten protein. This has a few effects. First, it will weaken the gluten network, resulting in a more pliable dough. However, in the limit (and we did this), the dough will become paste-like - not very attractive, but still tasty as a pizza dough. Second, as the protease cuts the proteins, more flavourful peptides and amino acids are released. This includes glutamine, which provides umami taste. The *amylase* in the koji will work on cutting the starches to smaller units, called dextrins, and eventually cut them into individual glucose units (recall starch is just a chain of glucose molecules).

The glucose and short-chained dextrin molecules can be consumed by the yeast, but more likely they will combine with the recently-liberated peptides via the Maillard reaction. The abundance of glucose and peptides causes a deeper browning and more flavour than dough without these enzymes. You can see the results below:

There's a very clear difference. Immediately upon pulling the koji-loaf, one could smell a *cheesy-like* crust, and even taste cheese notes later. The crumb was moister as well, likely because of the released water previously trapped by starch molecules.

### Recipe with koji addition to dough


The recipe is adapted from the book *Flour, Water, Yeast, Salt*. It makes 2 large loaves. The total time, including proofing, is about 1 day. The poolish (a pre-ferment) is created first, and used in the final dough


<div class="recipe">

#### Poolish

<div class="recipe-ingredients">

- 500g white flour
- 500g, 27℃ water
- 0.4g (1/8 tsp) dried yeast **or** 1g fresh yeast.

</div>

1. Mix well the yeast and water together.
2. Add the yeast-water mixture to the flour, mix together.
3. Cover with lid, and leave at room temperature for 12h-14h.

#### Final dough

<div class="recipe-ingredients">

- 500g white flour
- 21g salt
- 3g (3/4 tsp) dried yeast **or** 7g fresh yeast.
- 250g warm water
- 300g barley koji
- 1000g of poolish (from previous step)

</div>

1. Blend half the water and the koji in food processor.
2. Mix first three ingredients into bowl.
3. Pour half the water around edges of poolish, loosening it from its container.
4. Pour water/poolish into bowl.
5. Add blended koji into bowl.
6. Mix with hands, and cover.
7. Fold the dough 2 or 3 times during the first few hours.
8. After the dough has doubled (a few hours), divide into halves.
9. Shape as you wish. Place into proofing baskets, and cover with towel or bag. We'll proof for an hour.
10. Preheat oven to 475℉  and put in a dutch oven with lid on.
11. At the end of proofing, line dutch oven with square of parchment paper, put in loaf.
12. Cover and bake for 30m, then uncover and bake for 20m-30m.
13. Remove loaf and let cool on cooling rack.

*Bread with koji added before proofing. Pretty!*
